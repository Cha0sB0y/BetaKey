# BetaKey

BetaKey is a clever closed beta solution for networks.
It's a BungeeCord plugin and a website.



How it works:
At first you create a unique key and send it to a player. This player can now enter this key at your website. Form now own this player can enter to the network until you deny him again.


Commands:
- "/BetaKey create" creates a random key. By clicking on the Key you copy it.
- "/BetaKey create PERMA" creates a random permanent key. By clicking on the Key you copy it.
- "/BetaKey delete <KEY>" deletes a key and you can't use it after that anymore
- "/BetaKey add <NAME>" add a player without using a key
- "/BetaKey remove <NAME>" remove a player from the whitelist (even those with code)
  
Permissions: - BetaKey.key


Website:
The Website is accesable by typing "http://yourIP.com:187" in your browser. Therefor you can create a subdomain or a link at your website.
This Website starts automatically with your BungeeCord plugin.

!!! The first player to join the server can join anyway !!!
